# SentimentAnalysisUsingBert
This Git repository contains code and resources for performing sentiment analysis using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art natural language processing model. The project aims to analyze the sentiment of text data and classify it in 5 cagtegories.
Key Features:
- Implementation of sentiment analysis using BERT-based models.
- Pre-processing scripts for text data.
